"""
Advent of Code 2024 Utilities

Organized into modules but accessible from top level for convenience:
- d2: 2D coordinate and grid operations
- d3: 3D coordinate and grid operations (explicit import required)
- graph: Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, max clique, flood fill, path counting)
- input: Data reading and parsing (Input and Parser classes)
- math: Number/math utilities
- ranges: Range and interval operations
- testing: Test framework

Import styles supported:
    # Simple (recommended for puzzles)
    from aoc import Coord, Grid, bfs, Input, run, TestCase, merge_ranges, gcd, lcm

    # Explicit 2D (optional for clarity)
    from aoc.d2 import Coord, Grid, Dimension

    # Explicit 3D (required for 3D types)
    from aoc.d3 import Coord, Grid, Dimension
