# Examples

This directory contains example code to help you get started with aoc-toolkit.

## Solution Template

**[template_solution.py](template_solution.py)** - Copy this to start your AOC solution

This template includes:
- Recommended file structure
- Import patterns for common operations
- Test runner setup for part 1 and part 2
- Commented examples for grid navigation, shortest paths, and graphs

### How to Use

1. **Copy the template to your project:**
   ```bash
   cp examples/template_solution.py your_project/solution.py
   ```

2. **Create your data directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p your_project/data
   # Add your puzzle input files here
   ```

3. **Start coding!** The template has everything you need.

## Coming Soon

More examples will be added showing real AOC puzzle solutions:
- Grid-based maze navigation
- Graph shortest path algorithms
- Coordinate system patterns
- Complex data parsing scenarios
